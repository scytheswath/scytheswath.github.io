Watching them crawl up the walls, leaving their shiny silver trails like an invading alien species, it occurred to me that the most fundamental challenge network security professionals face is that information <em>wants</em> to be free. </p>
<p>Ordered patterns are such a rarity in the universe that there is an extreme gradient around the edges of their existence and therefore - monstrous osmotic pressure to expand, proliferate and propagate.</p>

<p>Most of our equipment, protocols, and algorithms have the express purpose of connecting devices and disseminating, replicating signals and in that environment protecting against bad actors is like herding cats that have the habit of dying on you if you observe the wrong quantum state.</p>
<p>This dynamic is not limited to human creations - life itself, at the molecular level is a self-replicating information storing device and everything from DNA to prions <em>wants</em> to replicate the information it carries and transmit it as far as possible. This is a force that seems to exist quite independently of any of the phenomena it appears to be driving and it’s all-encompassing and unstoppable.</p>
<p>Choose strong passwords is what I’m trying to say I guess.</p>
