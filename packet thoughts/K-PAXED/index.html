<p>You hear stories of CCIE candidates abandoning their families for months on end - moving out of their houses and completely devoting themselves to the task, and I always thought ‘That’s a bit dramatic isn’t it?’ but I did find myself in a hotel room in the Wood Green Travelodge staring at topologies on my laptop and cycling through practice exams with a can of double espressos, kitchen foil on the smoke detector, and staff threatening to kick me out.<br>Now, my studies were nowhere near CCIE intensity, the reason I wasn’t in my house was a gas leak that caused the kitchen to be dismantled (and a baby buggy to be stored in my room) and the residents of wood green are the opposite of the drummers, but it did feel like I am putting myself in a completely different mode to accomplish a task. And it was an empowering experience. The Buddha was a man. John Percival Hackworth was a man. And what one man can do another can do.</p>

<p>I passed the exam and didn’t get kicked out of the hotel so - op success. On returning to my house, however, still high on my victory i realized I had been so consumed by what I must do, by what Wood Green is doing to me, that I had been blind to what I am doing to Wood Green. You see, making someone aware of the existence of the bluebird seems to be wholesome deed, but in a place where an army of cats is enforcing a 24/7 no-fly zone, it can be a dangerous one. The anti-drummers are not interested in birds and tasks and cures. They’re consumed by feeding, breeding, and fear.</p>

<p>I’m sorry Wood Green - I made it clear in the beginning - I can only take one cat with me when I leave (this is due to the limitations of light travel and the unique quantum configuration of black cats). I will be filing a full report, as is customary on my planet, the classification remains the same BA-3; comments: mostly harmless:)</p>
