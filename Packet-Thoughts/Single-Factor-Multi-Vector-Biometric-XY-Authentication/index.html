<p><img src="/content/images/safeguardingagainstextremismisnotspying.png" alt="Safe guarding against extremism is not spying"></p>
<p>There was  a bunch of armed police outside doing something in the house next door, we smiled and nodded at each other while I was smoking. I didn’t dare ask. </p>
<a id="more"></a>


<p>Anyway, I guess because  had a bunch of acronyms, encryption algorithms and mantraps knocking around in my head I suddenly came up with a novel authentication method for logging into a system. It would employ a blood draw and visual organ recognition. You would need to hook an IV to a suitable vein and feed it into the analyzer and then you would place your organ in front the camera and do whatever you need to do for the software to recognise it. Upon successful login, a correctly configured system would autoplay a pre-selected video or [extreme caution advised] a random one from a selected web source.</p>
<p>I leant back, amazed at my invetiveness but suddenly realised I have missed something - how would girls log in? But then a (packet) thought came to me: kitchen computers are on auto login.</p>
<p>That’s how the proctors found me - gazing at that poster, laughing at my own unspoken joke.</p>
<p>Later, on my way out, I noticed the police had escalated to search dogs. Only 10:40 on a  Tuesday and so much has already happened…</p>
<p>ps: no mad, girls -  you know I’m gay for you:)) </p>
